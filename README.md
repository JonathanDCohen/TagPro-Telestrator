TagPro-Telestrator
==================

Telestrator userscript for the game TagPro.

Simply click and drag to draw on the tagpro map.  Your drawings will automatically scale with zoom and stay in position relative to the map, even if the camera is moving around. 

Controls:
* Click-Drag: freehand draw
* Shift-Click-Drag: draw an arrow
* Alt-Click-Drag: draw a circle
* Alt-Shift-Click a player: trace that player's path.  This is still finnicky.
* Double Click: erase drawings

By default, this userscript disables reporting a player by clicking their ball so that it doesn't get in the way of your drawing.  
If you want to allow reporting by clicking, set the "kickClick" variable at the top of the script to true.
