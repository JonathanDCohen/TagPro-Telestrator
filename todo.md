# TODO
- [x] Clear off-screen curve segments -- this works as-is, drawing off canvas requires a rewrite of the tricky conversion code
- [x] Shift-click for arrows
- [x] Circle drawing
- [ ] Get rid of the extra loop in curve drawing
- [ ] Follow player paths
- [ ] Cache shapes while in center view
- [ ] Potentially also in follow mode? Zoom changes are infrequent
